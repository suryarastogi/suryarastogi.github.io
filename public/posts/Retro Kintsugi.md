## "Anything Not Saved Will Be Lost" - Nintendo

When I was younger I enjoyed playing with electronics. One of the first ones I had was a Nintendo Gameboy. I got a bootleg cartridge in india with something like 50 games on it. Since it was a bootleg cartridge, I never really knew what games they were until now. Super Mario Land, Contra, Tanks

Personal electronics in particular. Evolution of iPod into iPhone -- admiration for design of handhelds, Apple, Sony, Nintendo

Modding PSPs in high school. Playimg shin budokai

Purchasing ps5 during covid

Even now nothing feels like getting new a game console

Rebuying my childhood -- all the consoles I had, all the ones I wish I had
